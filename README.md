# cluster_validation

This repo is under developpment. 

The aim of CLUSTER_VALIDATION is to provide tools to investigate the properties of detected galaxy clusters with respect to the true halos (e.g. redMaPPer cosmo-DC2 detections wrt cosmo DC2 halos). The association methods developped can also be used to match two different mock catalogs.
